## Install RAPIDS on Sagemaker Studio Lab
Our in depth install guide is [here, if you want to preview it](rapids-smsl.ipynb): 

To run this guide, you only need two things:
1. An active SageMaker Studio Lab account (get one here: https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/)
1. An actively running GPU instance in that account

When you have that ready, if you want to just install RAPIDS into SageMaker Studio Lab, the easiest way is:
1. Click this button [![Open in SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://rapidsa.ai/smsl.html)
2. Click the `Copy to Project` button
3. When prompted, select `Clone Entire Repo`
4. After customizing any directories, ensure that `Search for environment.yml and build Conda environment` is checked and click `Clone`
5. Once completed, please go to **[Links to RAPIDS Notebooks and Repos](rapids-smsl.ipynb#Links-to-RAPIDS-Notebooks-and-Repos)** and get some Notebooks to run RAPIDS on!
